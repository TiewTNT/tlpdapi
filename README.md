# TXCPAPI

**TXCPAPI** (pronounced *tek-sac-pay-pee*, obviously) is a minimalist, anarchic API for compiling TeX files. It runs without authentication, without rate limiting, and without shame. If you're looking for security, stability, or adult supervision... this isn't it.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Accepts `.tex` or `.zip` uploads via a `/api` endpoint
- Compiles the files using LaTeX engines (`pdflatex`, `xelatex`, etc.) or ConTeXt
- Converts output to various formats: PDF, HTML, Markdown, plain text, images
- Returns the final result directlyâ€”no signup, no storage, no questions asked
- Uptime is theoretically possible but not guaranteed.
- Comes with guaranteed bugs.
